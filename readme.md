# Cost-Effective Multi-Channel Notification System

Long long back when few of my colleagues started with thier first startup, they approached me for a help in developing a system to manage all thier communications with thier customers. I was more than happy to get my hands dirty in development as real life scenarios are rare for engineers to work alone and find a solution. I was able to develop it, but thats not the end. Soon after I realized that this is something serious which most startups or small businesses are facing. I have implemented the same with multiple other local brands and they were happy about it.

wanted to share with you all the way I implement it. I won't be able to provide you the exact code copy which may allow attackers to take advantage in few scenarios, but ill be providing code snippets that are ready to work but needs customization for a rich experience.
